# Introduction #
In this wiki you will find basic instructions for Installation, Basic Usage, and Usage with geektool.


# Installation #
## Download ##
To install the yWeather Script, you must first download it and save it, or move it to the place you want it to permanently stay. The convention for user commands in a unix environment is to put them in your directory, in a sub directory named bin.

Example:
`/Users/<username>/bin`

## Making Executable ##
Once the script is in the location you want, using terminal navigate to it. We now need to make it executable, this is done with the `chmod` command. This is done with the following command:

`chmod +x yweather.pl`

## Issues ##
The problem with this approach, is similar to using commands installed with MacPorts, Geektool can not execute them with just the command name, so you must use the full path name instead of just the command name. (note: I am working a new version of Geektool that will include the $PATH variable from your bash environment which will make using MacPorts easier with Geektool)
